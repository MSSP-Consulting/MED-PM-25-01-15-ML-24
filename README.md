## Project Summary: 
This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of quiz items in distinguishing between high- and lowperforming students while assessing whether demographic factors influence test performance. Through a combination of correlation analysis and statistical testing, we identified key patterns in item discrimination, item difficulty, and technical item flaws.


## Description of the files in the repository: 
data folder
This folder contains most of the experimental data, including:

Client scores on the language test performances of different medical students;

Ratings on the discriminative power of different test items.

figures folder
This folder stores images generated from exploratory data analysis (EDA).

models folder
We have uploaded the following analysis files to assess whether various indicators have significant effects (i.e., the files shown in the image):

25NewDataAnalysis.Rmd – New round of data analysis.

correlation.Rmd – Correlation analysis.

IRRanalysis.Rmd – Inter-Rater Reliability (IRR) analysis.

Kappa_test.Rmd – Kappa test.

NormailtyCheck.Rmd – Normality check (note: there's a typo; it may be intended as NormalityCheck.Rmd).

T-test and U-test.Rmd – T-test and U-test analysis.

intake form and final report
Includes participant intake forms and the final analysis report.
